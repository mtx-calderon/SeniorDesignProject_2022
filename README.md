This was my senior design project.
My goal was to make a gadget that could be put onto any piano and light up select keys based on a scale choses by the user
depending on which setting is chosen, then different combinations of keys will light up. Which are called scales.
For example, user picked in the key of G major, so the G major keys will only be lit!
